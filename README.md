|  1.  | Drinks: there are some drinks on sale, each with price and quantity in stock. Visitors can choose a drink to get and purchase it.                                                       | [`6598d21`](https://github.com/kaykayehnn/BarSimulator/commit/6598d21821562072785d3b0d2955a605f7ad0eb8) |
|  2.  | Visitors have a budget to spend.                                                                                                                                                        | [`e22c0b1`](https://github.com/kaykayehnn/BarSimulator/commit/e22c0b18c894b36ed2a44c809e2e15b98c1ca7ee) |
|  3.  | Visitors have age and the Bar doesn't let in people below 18.                                                                                                                           | [`2962dec`](https://github.com/kaykayehnn/BarSimulator/commit/2962dec87c6e7758f6f5742e3ed7c554f7f3c702) |
|  4.  | Visitors that wait in the queue may decide (randomly) to leave the queue and walk the streets again. Bonus points if the longer they wait, the more they are likely to leave the queue. | [`ba4f710`](https://github.com/kaykayehnn/BarSimulator/commit/ba4f710eaa47f88156bcfa4c34bab865fc4af91)  |
